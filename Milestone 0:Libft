Libft project contains two main parts: 

MANDATORY PART: You need to replicate the following functions. 
                You can create them on the order that you prefer , just keep in mind , that create some fuctions before others can help you to have a shorter and cleaner code.
  - Libc functions:
    isalpha	    strlen		memset		bzero
    isdigit	    strlcpy		memcpy		atoi
    isalnum	    strlcat		memmove	  	toupper
    isasci	    strchr		memchr		tolower
    isprint	    strrchr		memcmp		calloc (you will need malloc)
		    strncmp
		    strnstr
		    strdup ( you will need malloc)
  - Additional functions
    ft_substr	ft_split       ft_putchar_fd
    ft_strjoin	ft_itoa	       ft_putstr_fd
    ft_strtrim		       ft_putendl_fd
    ft_strmapi		       ft_putnbr_fd
    ft_striteri

BONUS PART:  You need to replicate the following functions . 
             This is a bonus part , is not required to pass your libft milestone. Coding, you know, is based on optimize resources , if you learn these functions now ...
             My advice is to try them.  UP TO YOU !
    ft_lstnew		  ft_lstdelone			
    ft_lstadd_front	  ft_lstadd_back
    ft_lstsize		  ft_lstclear
    ft_lstlast		  ft_lstiter
    ft_lstmap

I reccomend you to have a look at this repository : https://github.com/eg-delacruz/42-libft/blob/master/README.md where you can find a very clear explanation of what each function does.
