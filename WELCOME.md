# Libft
The libft project at 42Madrid aims to teach C programming by providing a custom library with common and useful functions. Students learn to understand, implement, and use these functions, which are essential for basic file I/O operations.

This repository is intended to be a study guide to understand how functions included on libft works. 
You will also have access to my code. Don't copy it! use it for educational purposes and to make sure that you understand how to write your own code. 

42Madrid is based on  peer2peer learning method , therefore this repository include lessons learnt from other peers.  I strongly encourage to visit their git pages they can show you other way to create your code. 

Hope you find this resource as useful as I found the ones who helped me. 

Happy to hear your feedback!. 
Good learning!
