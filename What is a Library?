The C programming language is not limited to print text to the standard output, we can access complex data, interact with the web, play with graphics and more. 
The secret to do that is to understand and use C libraries. Libraries can boost our C program’s potential. 
This libraries are found free on the internet, so we can download, install and use them. 

What is a library?

First of all we need to understand that one of the bunch of tools that compilers provide us are the libraries:
  A library is basically just an archive of object files. And is made up of useful and reusable code
  Is a collection of header files, exposed for use by other programs. 
  The library therefore consists of an interface expressed in a .h file (named the "header") and an implementation expressed in a .c file.”
  
  If you have a bunch of files that contain just functions, you can turn these source files into libraries that can be used statically or dynamically by programs. 
  This is good for program modularity, and code re-use. Write Once, Use Many.

Why use libraries?

The general philosophy behind libraries is that…

    They allow code reuse.
    Provide special access to some aspects of the hardware or software.
    We should use them because the libraries have gone through rigorous testing and work, so they have been optimized to have a good performance.
    And libraries work everywhere.
